# Energy-Consumption-Prediction-for-Smart-Homes

- In this technological era everything is made to act smart. So is a home. 

- A smart home is a place where all devices are designed to operate intelligently and can be programmed to maximize their benefits.

- Despite these advancements, many buildings still experience inefficient energy use, leading to high costs and environmental impact.

 - This project aims to predict energy usage and provide insights to optimize energy consumption and to help homeowners & building managers, to make informed decisions, reduce energy costs, and to promote sustainability.
