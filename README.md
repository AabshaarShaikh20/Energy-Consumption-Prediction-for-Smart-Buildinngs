- In this technological era everything is made to act smart. So is a home. 

-  Recently, smart building concept has been adapted more frequently as an initiative to create an intelligent space area by taking advantage of the rapid development of computational and communication architecture


## But what are smart buildings exactly? 

- A smart home is a place where all devices are designed to operate intelligently and can be programmed to maximize their benefits.

-	But despite this advancements and all, one of the key challenges in Smart Home Technology is optimising energy utilization, which can be achieved through the use of ML techniques.
  
 - This project aims to predict energy usage and provide insights to optimize energy consumption and to help homeowners & building managers, to make informed decisions, reduce energy costs, and to promote sustainability.
