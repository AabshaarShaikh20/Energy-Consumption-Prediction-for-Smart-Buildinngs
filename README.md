# Energy-Consumption-Prediction-for-Smart-Homes

In this technological era everything is made to act smart. So is a home. 

A smart home is a place where all devices are designed to operate intelligently and can be programmed to maximize their benefits.

Despite these advancements, many buildings still experience inefficient energy use, leading to high costs and environmental impact.

This project aims to predict energy usage and provide insights to optimize energy consumption and to help homeowners & building managers, to make informed decisions, reduce energy costs, and to promote sustainability.
